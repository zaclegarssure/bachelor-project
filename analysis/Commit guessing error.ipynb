    "## Goal\n",
    "Here we will try to estimate how many erros we did while guessing the right commit, for certain flatpak dependencies. More precisely, some dependencies (base app, sdk extension and flatpak builder) are not bound by a specific commit, we only know that the program was built using the latest available dependencies at the time. The problem is, we don't know the exact time of the build therefore we take what was the lastest available at ostree-commit time (after the build), which means that if a dependency was updated during this time slice, our guess will be wrong."

    "To estimate the probability of error, we already can bound the build time between the git commit (which is known to be before the build) and the ostree commit (which is after), we will then assume that the build is distributed uniformly inside, even if it is a bit unrealistic we cannot really guess what distribution it should have. And then if one of it's dependency had a commit in this interval, we can easily compute the probability of error. If multiple dependencies are present we just do the join error (probability that at least one is wrong)."
