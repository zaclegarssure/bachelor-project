    abstract="A software supply chain attack is characterized by
        the injection of malicious code into a software package
        in order to compromise dependent systems further down
        the chain. Recent years saw a number of supply chain
        attacks that leverage the increasing use of open source
        during software development, which is facilitated by
        dependency managers that automatically resolve, download
        and install hundreds of open source packages throughout
        the software life cycle. Even though many approaches for
        detection and discovery of vulnerable packages exist, no
        prior work has focused on malicious packages. This paper
        presents a dataset as well as analysis of 174 malicious
        software packages that were used in real-world attacks
        on open source software supply chains and which were
        distributed via the popular package repositories npm,
    PyPI, and RubyGems. Those packages, dating from November 2015
        to November 2019, were manually collected and analyzed.
        This work is meant to facilitate the future development
        of preventive and detective safeguards by open source
        and research communities.",
